# Pollen

Pollen is a start page I wrote to make web browsing an easier, keyboard-based experience for myself.  The search form accepts URLs and search terms.  The YouTube and Wikipedia forms also accepts search terms.  The other forms are just static links that you can type Enter to visit.

By default the links are as follows:  Duck Duck Go, YouTube, Gmail, Wikipedia, Reddit, Facebook and Netflix.
